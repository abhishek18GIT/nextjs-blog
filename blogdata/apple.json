    "content":"By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it; Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed.[70] In April of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage.[71][72] Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.[73] The two decided on the name Apple after Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the farm's apple orchard.[74] Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $240 in 2021) each. To fund the first batch, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.[75][76] Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.[77][78] Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.[79]",
