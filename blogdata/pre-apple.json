    "content":"In February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job.[53] He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, as a technician.[53][54] Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs. According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company, and they thought that he had built it himself.[55] Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as difficult but valuable,he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that.During this period, Jobs and Brennan remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people. By early 1974, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a simple life in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money for his impending trip to India.",
