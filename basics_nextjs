styling :

global styling

    importing a css file from a node module is permitted any where between the application 
    for global style sheet , we can import inside pages/_app.js
    on conclusion 
        if we want a style sheet to apear on every page of the application we should global style
        but if we want to use on only a particular page we can save file with .module.css ext 
            and then import on that page 

styled jsx

    it is css in js library that allows you to write encapsulated and scoped css to style compoments 
    the styles you introduce for one compoment won't affect other compoments
    so we can write css inside any compoment like this 
        <style jsx>
        {`
            .class{
                background-color:red;
            }
        `}

_app.js 
    
    it is the file which is present on every page 
    therefore the things which we want to be present on every page should put inside it 
    like navbar , header etc
